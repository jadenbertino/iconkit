- After changing any file, run `npx prettier --write <filepath> > /dev/null` to format the code silently
- Whenver you need to use `tsx`, run it like so: `source env/.env.$ENVIRONMENT && export DOPPLER_TOKEN && doppler run -- npx tsx ...`
- All exports should be 1) named and 2) at the bottom of the file
- Prefer "fail fast" behavior: throw errors instead of returning null/undefined/"unknown" values
  - All `supabaseAdmin` and `supabasePublic` queries should tack on the `.throwOnError()` method and only destructure the `data` property
- I'm using `pnpm` as my package manager.
- Order functions from highest to lowest abstraction level
