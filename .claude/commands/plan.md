# Create Feature Specification

Create a detailed specification for a new feature or change.

Understand all requirements completely.
Do not move on until you are 95% sure you understand all requirements.
Ask me as many follow-up questions as you need to reach this level of confidence.

Identify these key components of the plan:

- High-Level Objective
- Requirements
- Technical Requirements
- Implementation Plan
- Files to create or modify
- Testing Strategy

After creating the spec, ask if I should proceed with implementation.
